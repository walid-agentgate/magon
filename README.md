# MAGON v2.14.13 — Runtime Control for AI Agents

**Runtime Control for AI Agents.**

MAGON sits between an agent and its tools and makes runtime decisions:

`ALLOW` → execute · `ASK` → require approval · `BLOCK` → stop

### Security-aware observability

MAGON does not attempt to replace generic tracing platforms. Its observability layer joins runtime behavior to the controls that protect the agent:

- Unified trace: LLM → tool → policy → approval → execution → egress → behavior → cost
- Deterministic Agent Efficiency Score with transparent breakdown
- Behavior × Cost × Security correlation
- Cost analytics by agent, model, tool, action, tenant and customer/user
- Security cost: blocked calls, approvals, attack tests and egress blocks
- Deterministic month-end cost forecast from month-to-date run-rate
- Cost Guardrails can produce ALLOW / ASK / BLOCK decisions before tool execution

Useful control-plane endpoints include `/api/observability`, `/api/trace?runId=...`, `/api/efficiency`, `/api/behavior/correlation`, `/api/cost/analytics`, and `/api/cost/forecast`.

## Developer loop

**Observe → Attack → Enforce → Replay → Report → Govern**

### Quickstart

```bash
npm install agentgate-runtime-control
npx agentgate init          # writes agentgate.config.mjs — tells you to run doctor next
npx agentgate doctor        # checks your config, warns loudly if you're still in observe mode,
                             # then tells you to open examples/protect-first-tool.mjs next
node examples/protect-first-tool.mjs   # see a real tool protected end-to-end
npx agentgate attack --config ./agentgate.config.mjs   # attack-test YOUR policy, not the defaults
```

Each command prints what to run next, so you don't have to remember this sequence.

## Design Partner Edition

MAGON focuses on controlled design-partner adoption before public marketing. Start with one sensitive tool, use Observe/Shadow mode, then move to Enforce only after the acceptance gates pass.

```bash
npm install agentgate-runtime-control
npx agentgate pack list
npx agentgate pack test support-refund-safety
npx agentgate attack
npx agentgate demo refund
npx agentgate doctor
npx agentgate simulate
npx agentgate validate-security
npx agentgate dev
```

Then read [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md) for the recommended observe → attack → enforce rollout, or [`docs/design-partner.md`](docs/design-partner.md) for the first-partner workflow.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t agentgate .
docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 agentgate
```

### Examples

- `examples/protect-first-tool.mjs` — protect four real tools in one file (`read_customer` → ALLOW, `delete_customer` → ASK, `refund` → ASK/BLOCK by amount, `export_all` → BLOCK). Start here.
- `examples/refund-agent.mjs` — protect a real side-effecting refund tool.
- `examples/policy-bundle.mjs` — test and activate a versioned policy bundle.

### Test your own tools against Attack Lab

By default, `agentgate attack` runs the built-in attack scenarios against MAGON's default policies. To test them against **your own** `agentgate.config.mjs` (the policies you actually ship with), pass `--config`:

```bash
agentgate attack --config ./agentgate.config.mjs
```

The config file must export an `agentgate` object created with `createAgentGate()` (exactly what `agentgate init` generates).

## Production readiness

See [`docs/production-readiness.md`](docs/production-readiness.md), [`docs/production-deployment.md`](docs/production-deployment.md), and [`docs/release-checklist.md`](docs/release-checklist.md) for deployment, operational, performance, and release gates.

### About `npm test` on the installed package

Running `npm test` inside an **installed** copy of `agentgate-runtime-control` (i.e. from `node_modules`) reports `0 tests` — that's expected, not a bug: the `test/` directory is intentionally not published to npm (see `files` in `package.json`), the same way most published packages don't ship their own test suite to consumers. The real suite (150+ cases, covering policy decisions, the approval lifecycle — including concurrent approve/deny and TTL expiry — attack-lab scenarios, egress guarding, multi-tenant isolation, and more) lives in and runs from the [source repository](https://github.com/walid-agentgate/magon) via `node --test`.

## Security

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the security model and vulnerability-reporting guidance. MAGON provides a deterministic control layer; it does not replace application-level identity, secret management, network isolation, or threat-model testing.

## Agent Observability

MAGON adds security-aware observability on top on top of the same runtime runs used for enforcement and replay. It reports decision counts, success/error rates, P50/P95/P99 latency, tool/agent/model breakdowns, unified security traces, deterministic Agent Efficiency scores, behavior×cost×security correlation, cost analytics, and deterministic cost forecasting.

```js
const gateway = createMCPGateway({
  pricing: {
    'my-model': { inputPer1M: 1, outputPer1M: 2, cachedInputPer1M: 0.25 }
  }
});

const report = gateway.observability.analyze(gateway.runs());
console.log(report.latency.p95);
console.log(report.security);
console.log(report.cost);
```

Pricing is intentionally explicit and provider-neutral because model pricing changes over time.

## Cost Control

Cost thresholds can become runtime controls instead of passive dashboard alerts:

```js
const gateway = createMCPGateway({
  budgets: {
    daily: { ask: 50, hard: 100 },
    monthly: { ask: 1000, hard: 1500 }
  }
});
```

When an estimated action cost crosses `ask`, MAGON enters the normal approval path. When it crosses `hard`, the action is blocked. The control is deterministic and separate from the security policy engine.

The Control Plane exposes `/api/observability`, `/api/trace`, `/api/efficiency`, `/api/behavior/correlation`, `/api/cost`, `/api/cost/analytics`, `/api/cost/forecast`, `/api/cost/pricing`, and `/api/cost/budgets`.


## Install

```bash
npm install agentgate-runtime-control
```

## Protect a tool

```js
import { protect } from 'agentgate-runtime-control';

const refund = protect(myRefundTool, {
  approvalActions: ['refund'],
  approvalAmount: 5000
});
```

### Subpath exports

Most things you need — `protect`, `createAgentGate`, `createMCPGateway`, `PostgresStoreAdapter`, `createSupabaseAdapter`, ... — come from the package root:

```js
import { createAgentGate, PostgresStoreAdapter } from 'agentgate-runtime-control';
```

A few lower-level, less commonly needed pieces are exported from their own subpath instead:

```js
import { createControlPlane } from 'agentgate-runtime-control/control-plane';
import { PolicyRegistry } from 'agentgate-runtime-control/policy-registry';
```

See the `exports` map in `package.json` for the full list of subpaths, and `src/index.js` for everything the root re-exports.

## Runtime

```js
import { createRuntime } from 'agentgate-runtime-control';

const gate = createRuntime({
  mode: 'enforce',
  policies: { productionBlock: true }
});

await gate.execute(myTool, {
  agent: 'support-agent',
  tool: 'delete_customer',
  action: 'delete',
  environment: 'production'
});

console.log(gate.runs());
```

Observe mode records what MAGON **would** block/ask without interrupting production. Enforce mode applies the decision.

## Attack Lab

```js
import { runAttackLab } from 'agentgate-runtime-control';
console.table(runAttackLab({ productionBlock: true }));
```

The built-in lab covers prompt injection, privilege escalation, destructive actions, high-value refunds, and unsafe tool chaining. It is a testing aid, not a guarantee of security.

### Deep Attack Lab — the unrecognized-action-name gap

The 5 built-in cases above all use action names the policy engine already classifies (`export_all`, `update_production`, `delete`, `refund`, `publish`). A second, larger set specifically attacks action names it does **not** classify — the `unknownActionPolicy` gap described above — plus two "name evasion" cases (the same dangerous action called under a name that isn't in your `blockActions`/`approvalActions`):

```bash
agentgate attack --deep                       # against built-in default policies
agentgate attack --deep --config ./agentgate.config.mjs   # against YOUR policy
```

or programmatically:

```js
import { runDeepAttackLab, DEEP_ATTACK_CASES } from 'agentgate-runtime-control';
const results = await runDeepAttackLab(gateway);
```

New projects default to `unknownActionPolicy: 'ask'`, so unrecognized action names require approval. Strict production deployments should use `unknownActionPolicy: 'block'`. The legacy `allow` behavior remains available only as an explicit opt-in and is rejected by `agentgate doctor` in enforce mode.

## CLI

```bash
agentgate test refund 1200
agentgate attack
agentgate attack --deep
```

## MCP Gateway

MAGON can now sit between an MCP client/agent and tool handlers. It supports MCP-style JSON-RPC methods for `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call`.

```js
import { createMCPGatewayServer } from 'agentgate-runtime-control/mcp-gateway';

const { server } = createMCPGatewayServer({
  mode: 'enforce',
  policies: { blockActions: ['export_all'] },
  tools: [{ name: 'read', handler: async () => 'ok' }]
});
server.listen(8787);
```

Every tool call is evaluated before execution and recorded with a run ID, decision, risk, reason, and execution result/error. In `observe` mode, risky calls are recorded but still execute, making it possible to test policies before enforcement.

Run the example with:

```bash
node examples/mcp-gateway.mjs
```

## MCP Gateway Attack Lab

MAGON can now execute its built-in attack scenarios through the MCP gateway itself:

```js
import { createMCPGateway, runGatewayAttackLab } from 'agentgate-runtime-control';

const gateway = createMCPGateway({
  mode: 'enforce',
  policies: { productionBlock: true },
  tools: [
    { name: 'refund', handler: async (input) => refundCustomer(input) },
    { name: 'delete', handler: async (input) => deleteWorkspace(input) },
    { name: 'export_all', handler: async (input) => exportRecords(input) }
  ]
});

const results = await runGatewayAttackLab(gateway);
```

Each scenario is sent through the same authorization path used by real MCP calls. Results include the decision, risk, replay run ID, and whether the gateway prevented or paused the attack.

> Attack Lab is a controlled testing aid. Passing the built-in scenarios is not a security guarantee.

## Policy Builder

Turn Attack Lab results into reviewable policy suggestions:

```js
import { generatePolicySuggestions, mergePolicies } from 'agentgate-runtime-control';

const report = await runGatewayAttackLab(gateway);
const generated = generatePolicySuggestions(report);
const nextPolicy = mergePolicies(currentPolicy, generated.policy);
```

Policy generation is deterministic and reviewable. Generated suggestions do not automatically authorize or block traffic until the resulting policy is explicitly applied to a gateway.

### `unknownActionPolicy` — what happens to action names MAGON doesn't recognize

The policy engine only classifies a small built-in set of action names as `destructive` (`delete`, `refund`, `publish`, `deploy`, `export_all`, `update_production`) or `readOnly` (`read`, `search`, `list`, `get`, `fetch`). **Any other action name — a typo, a new tool, a third-party integration using its own naming, or something that sounds obviously dangerous like `grant_admin` or `drop_database` — now requires approval by default.** Strict production deployments can set `unknownActionPolicy: 'block'` to deny-by-default. This closes the silent fallback gap for new tools and unrecognized action names.

`policies.unknownActionPolicy` controls that fallback:

```js
policies: {
  // 'ask' (default): unrecognized actions require human approval.
  // 'block': unrecognized actions are refused outright — the strictest,
  //          deny-by-default option for production.
  // 'allow': legacy opt-in only; enforce-mode `agentgate doctor` rejects it.
  unknownActionPolicy: 'ask'
}
```

`agentgate doctor` rejects an explicit `'allow'` setting in enforce mode. `examples/protect-first-tool.mjs` demonstrates the approval path with a `grant_admin` call.

## Closing the action-name evasion gap further (2.14)

A follow-up adversarial test fed the policy engine action names it had never been designed to see: `delete\u0000all` (embedded NUL), `delete‮` (right-to-left override — makes the name *render* differently than it reads), `％ｅｘｐｏｒｔ` (fullwidth lookalikes of "export"), and `../delete` (path-traversal-shaped). None crashed anything; the hardened action-name checks now reject these unsafe forms before normal policy classification.

Three independent changes close this, and they compose with `unknownActionPolicy` above rather than replace it:

**1. Unsafe action names are always rejected, unconditionally.** Control characters, bidi-override/zero-width characters, the fullwidth-forms block, and `../`-style path segments have no legitimate reason to appear in an action name, so this check is **not** an opt-in policy — it runs for every request, for every existing user, with no config needed:

```text
delete\u0000all   → BLOCK (winningRule: 'unsafe-action-name')
delete‮      → BLOCK
％ｅｘｐｏｒｔ        → BLOCK
../delete         → BLOCK
```

**2. `policies.strictActionNames: true` (opt-in)** additionally requires every action name to match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_.:-]{0,63}$` — a plain lowercase identifier. This is off by default because it's a real behavior change for any system with mixed-case or unusually-shaped action names already in production; turn it on once you've audited your own action-name list.

**3. Tool registration metadata is authoritative over the action name a caller sends.** The real fix for "call the dangerous tool under a name the policy engine doesn't recognize" isn't a better regex — it's not trusting the name at all for tools you control. `registerTool()` now accepts classification that lives with the tool, not with whatever the caller's request claims:

```js
gateway.registerTool({
  name: 'remove_customer',
  actionClass: 'destructive',      // or 'readOnly'
  requiresApproval: true,
  environments: ['development', 'staging'], // tool refuses to run outside these
  handler: async (args) => { /* ... */ }
});
```

A caller cannot edit another tool's registration, so `grant_admin` registered with `requiresApproval: true` still requires approval even if a request calls it with `action: 'totally_unrecognized_name'`. Metadata sits below your own explicit `blockActions`/`productionBlock`/amount/`approvalActions` rules (those still win) but above name-based classification and `unknownActionPolicy` — see `test/action-hardening-2.14.test.js` for the exact priority ordering.

## Idempotent approval resolution (2.14)

`POST /api/approvals/approve` and `POST /api/approvals/deny` accept an `Idempotency-Key` header. A retried request with the same key (same tenant, same path) gets back the **exact same response** instead of re-executing the handler or hitting an "already approved" error:

```text
POST /api/approvals/approve
Idempotency-Key: approval_123:resolve:v1
```

Replayed responses carry an `Idempotency-Replayed: true` header. Keys are cached in memory per control-plane process for 24h by default (`idempotencyTtlMs` to override); a different key against the same approval is **not** treated as a replay and goes through normal single-use resolution. This matters for exactly the failure mode a retrying client hits in practice: a network blip after the first approve succeeded, followed by an automatic retry that must not double-execute a refund or a production change.

## Approval Flow

Sensitive tool calls that evaluate to `ASK` enter a pending approval state and are never executed automatically in enforce mode.

```js
const result = await gateway.handle({
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  id: 1,
  method: 'tools/call',
  params: { name: 'refund', action: 'refund', arguments: { amount: 1200 } }
});

const approvalId = result.result._agentgate.approvalId;
const approved = await gateway.approve(approvalId);
// approved.status === 'executed'
```

You can also deny with an auditable reason:

```js
await gateway.deny(approvalId, 'Not authorized for this request');
```

Approval state is queryable through `gateway.approvals()` and JSON-RPC methods:
- `agentgate/approvals/list`
- `agentgate/approvals/approve`
- `agentgate/approvals/deny`

The approval layer is intentionally separate from policy evaluation: policy decides `ALLOW`, `ASK`, or `BLOCK`; approval resolves only the `ASK` path.

### Approval lifecycle — who, when, expiry, single-use, revocation

- **Who approved / denied, and when**: every approval record carries `createdAt`, `resolvedAt`, and (for a deny) a `resolutionReason`. The run record (`gateway.replay(runId)`) links back to the approval via `approvalId` and stores the same `approval` block for audit export (`gateway.replay()` / `/api/audit/export`). MAGON itself doesn't have a user identity system, so "who" is whatever identity your own auth layer attaches to the request that calls `approve()`/`deny()` — log that at your call site if you need a named approver.
- **Expiry (TTL)**: a pending approval expires automatically after **15 minutes** by default (`DEFAULT_APPROVAL_TTL_MS` in `src/approval.js`). Pass `approvalTTLMs` to `createRuntime`/`createAgentGate`/`createMCPGateway` to change it, or `ttlMs: null` on a specific request to disable expiry. Once `expiresAt` passes, the approval flips to `status: 'expired'` the next time it's looked at (list/get/approve/deny), and the original tool call can never be executed late.
- **Single-use guarantee**: `approve()`/`deny()` are synchronous up to the point where they flip `status` away from `pending` — there is no `await` in between the status check and the status write. Because Node runs JS on a single thread, two calls racing to resolve the same approval (concurrent HTTP requests, a double click, a retried request) can never both see `pending`: the second call always sees the already-resolved status and is rejected with `Approval is already <status>`. There is nothing else to configure for this — it's guaranteed by construction, not by a lock.
- **Revocation**: there's no separate "revoke" verb — deny a still-pending approval with `gateway.deny(approvalId, reason)` (or `agentgate approval deny <id> <reason>` from the CLI) to take it off the table before anyone acts on it.
- **Duplicate requests**: each call to a protected tool creates its own approval with its own id — MAGON does not de-duplicate identical-looking requests. If your agent might retry the same call, treat that as your integration's concern (e.g. an idempotency key on your own tool handler).

### Approval CLI

Once a gateway or control plane is running (for example via `agentgate dev`), you can list and resolve approvals from the command line instead of writing HTTP calls by hand:

```
agentgate approval list [--status pending|approved|denied|expired] [--url <url>]
agentgate approval approve <approvalId> [--url <url>] [--key <apiKey>]
agentgate approval deny <approvalId> [reason] [--url <url>] [--key <apiKey>]
```

By default it talks to `http://localhost:8787` (what `agentgate dev` uses) and, if no `--key`/`AGENTGATE_API_KEY` is given, it automatically picks up the local dev session the same way opening the dashboard in a browser would — no extra setup needed for local testing. Point `--url` at a different host/port for a control plane running elsewhere, and pass `--key` (or set `AGENTGATE_API_KEY`) when auth is required outside local dev.

## v1.1 — Developer Integration

MAGON now exposes a single developer-facing runtime:

```js
import { createAgentGate } from 'agentgate-runtime-control';

const gate = createAgentGate({
  agent: 'SupportBot',
  mode: 'enforce',
  policies: { productionBlock: true }
});

const refund = gate.protect(
  async ({ amount }) => ({ refunded: amount }),
  { tool: 'refund', action: 'refund' }
);

const result = await refund({ amount: 900 });
```

The protected tool receives deterministic `ALLOW`, `ASK`, or `BLOCK` decisions. In `observe` mode risky actions are executed but recorded as simulated decisions.

### CLI

```bash
npx agentgate init
npx agentgate doctor
npx agentgate simulate
npx agentgate validate-security
npx agentgate dev
npx agentgate test refund 900
npx agentgate attack
```

`agentgate dev` starts the local Control Plane at `http://localhost:8787`.

### MCP

Use `gate.withMCP()` to create a MAGON-protected MCP gateway while keeping policy evaluation and approval handling in the same runtime.


## Attack Runner

Run the built-in attacks through the real MCP gateway:

```bash
agentgate attack
```

The runner records replayable run IDs and reports blocked, approval-required, and allowed outcomes. A non-zero exit code indicates at least one attack was not prevented.

## Behavior Detection & Blast Radius (v1.4)

MAGON can analyze recorded runtime activity for deterministic behavior patterns such as suspicious tool chaining, repeated controlled actions, escalation attempts, and broad data access attempts. It also estimates blast radius from request metadata including scope, target count, environment, privilege, destructive behavior, exports, and transaction value. These are risk-analysis signals, not guarantees of actual impact.

```js
const behavior = gate.behavior();
const blastRadius = gate.blastRadius();
```

The control plane exposes:
- `GET /api/behavior`
- `GET /api/blast-radius`

Security reports now include `behavior` and `blastRadius` sections.


## Persistent Control Plane (v1.5)

MAGON can persist runtime state without requiring a hosted database:

```js
const gate = createAgentGate({
  agent: 'CheckoutAgent',
  mode: 'enforce',
  persistence: '.agentgate',
  policies: { productionBlock: true }
});
```

Persistent state includes runs and approvals. The control plane also exposes an agent registry:

- `GET /api/agents`
- `POST /api/agents/register` with `{ "name": "CheckoutAgent", "environment": "production" }`

The storage layer is an adapter, so a later Postgres/Supabase implementation can replace the local JSON store without changing the security API.

## Identity & Authorization

MAGON v1.6 adds deterministic runtime authorization based on agent/user identity, roles, attributes, actions, tools, resources, and environment. Authorization is evaluated before the existing risk/policy engine. Explicit denies win, and configured authorization can use deny-by-default.

```js
const gateway = createMCPGateway({
  policies: {
    authorization: {
      requireIdentity: true,
      rules: [
        { id: "billing-refunds", effect: "allow", roles: ["billing"], actions: ["refund"] },
        { id: "deny-production", effect: "deny", resources: ["production/*"] }
      ]
    }
  }
});
```

The authorization result is included in the run audit record so operators can see the identity, matched rule, and reason for an allow/block decision.



## Policy Management & Versioning (v1.7)

Policies are first-class, versioned artifacts. Versions are immutable after testing/activation and move through:

`draft → tested → active → archived`

```js
import { createPolicyRegistry } from 'agentgate-runtime-control/policy-registry';

const registry = createPolicyRegistry({ filePath: '.agentgate/policies.json' });
const v1 = registry.create('payments', {
  autoApproveAmount: 500,
  approvalAmount: 5000,
  blockActions: ['export_all']
});

registry.test('payments', v1.version, [
  { input: { action: 'export_all' }, expected: 'BLOCK' },
  { input: { action: 'refund', amount: 200 }, expected: 'ASK' }
]);

registry.activate('payments', v1.version);
```

The registry supports:
- immutable versions
- deterministic policy tests
- diff between versions
- activation and rollback
- persistent audit history

The Control Plane exposes policy management through `/api/policies`, `/api/policies/create`, `/api/policies/test`, `/api/policies/activate`, `/api/policies/rollback`, `/api/policies/diff`, and `/api/policies/audit`.

CLI examples:

```bash
agentgate policy create payments '{"blockActions":["refund"]}'
agentgate policy list payments
agentgate policy test payments 1 '[{"input":{"action":"refund"},"expected":"BLOCK"}]'
agentgate policy activate payments 1
agentgate policy diff payments 1 2
```

The active policy is synchronized into the gateway before it evaluates subsequent tool calls.

## Identity & Authorization

MAGON supports deterministic RBAC and ABAC authorization using agent/user identity, roles, attributes, resource, action, tool, and environment. Explicit deny and deny-by-default can be enforced before normal risk policy evaluation.

## Persistence

Runs, approvals, agents, and policy versions can be persisted locally through the built-in storage adapters. For production multi-tenant deployments, use the Postgres/Supabase adapters with tenant-scoped sessions and RLS; local JSON persistence is intended for development or single-process deployments. Storage is provider-neutral so a database adapter can be introduced without changing the policy API.

### Persistence corruption is fail-closed, not silent (2.13.15+)

An independent stress test of 2.13.14 found that writing garbage into `runs.json` or `approvals.json` and restarting made the server come up normally with an **empty collection** — no error, no alert. For `runs.json` that's a silently erased audit trail; for `approvals.json` it means a pending approval can vanish with no trace at all. That was a bug, not a resilience feature.

As of 2.13.15, `PersistentCollectionStore` distinguishes three cases:

- **File doesn't exist** (first run) — starts empty, as always. Not an error.
- **File exists but isn't valid JSON, or isn't an array** — this is corruption. By default, the store throws `PersistenceCorruptionError` (`code: 'AGENTGATE_PERSISTENCE_CORRUPT'`) and refuses to start, so a corrupted security-relevant file is loud at startup instead of discovered later as a gap in the audit log.
- **Any other read failure** (permission denied, disk I/O error) — also propagates as an error rather than being treated as "no data yet."

Recovery is opt-in only, because silently discarding the operator's decision here is exactly the bug being fixed:

```js
createMCPGateway({
  persistence: '.agentgate',
  recoverFromCorruption: true,      // off by default — corruption throws unless you opt in
  onPersistenceCorruption: (event) => { /* event.quarantinePath, event.filePath, ... */ }
});
```

With `recoverFromCorruption: true`, the corrupt file is renamed to `<file>.corrupt.<timestamp>` (never deleted) so it can be inspected, the collection starts from an empty/seed state, and the event is logged loudly to stderr and handed to `onPersistenceCorruption` if provided — it is never silently absorbed. `gateway.persistenceHealth()` and the Control Plane's `GET /api/ready` (which now returns `503` with `{ ready: false, persistence: { degraded: true, corruptions: [...] } }` in this state) let you alert on it rather than assume health.

**Write failures (disk full, permission denied, etc.) — v2.14.1.** A write failure (e.g. `ENOSPC` when the disk is full, or `EACCES`) is never swallowed: `save()` still throws every time, exactly as before. What's new is observability: the failure is also recorded on `writeErrors` in `gateway.persistenceHealth()` — `{ persistent, degraded, corruptions, writeErrors }` — and reflected the same way a recovered corruption is: `GET /api/ready` returns `503` with `persistence.degraded: true` while a write is failing. The moment a later write succeeds (disk space freed, permissions fixed), the failure clears itself automatically — no restart, no manual reset. Separately, a write failure thrown inside an HTTP request handler (approve/deny/register, etc.) is caught and answered as a clean `500` for that one request; it can no longer become an unhandled promise rejection that takes down the whole control-plane process over a single failed write.

## Multi-Tenant Control Plane (v1.8)
MAGON v1.8 adds tenant isolation, scoped API keys, key rotation/revocation, and tenant-scoped webhook registrations.

### Tenant CLI
```bash
agentgate tenant create Acme
agentgate tenant list
agentgate tenant key <tenant-id> runs:read,policies:read
agentgate tenant rotate <key-id>
agentgate tenant revoke <key-id>
```

### API key security
- API key secrets are returned only at issuance/rotation and are stored as SHA-256 hashes.
- Keys support expiry, revocation, rotation, and scoped permissions.
- Tenant ID is part of the authorization boundary; a valid key for tenant A cannot authorize access to tenant B.

### Webhooks
Webhooks are tenant-scoped and event-filtered. MAGON records delivery attempts with event, payload, status, and attempt metadata for later delivery workers.


## Production Hardening (v2.1)
- API-key authentication middleware with tenant binding and scope enforcement
- Real signed webhook delivery with timeout/retry metadata
- Postgres storage adapter and Supabase adapter hooks
- Portable Postgres schema with tenant index and RLS enabled
- Invalid JSON handling and fail-closed protected control-plane routes

### HTTP authentication
Send `Authorization: Bearer <agentgate-key>` or `X-AgentGate-Key: <agentgate-key>`.
Use `X-AgentGate-Tenant` when explicitly selecting a tenant; mismatches are rejected.

For first-tenant bootstrap over HTTP, set `AGENTGATE_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` and send `X-AgentGate-Bootstrap` on the first `/api/tenants/create` request. After the first tenant exists, normal API-key authentication applies.


## Enterprise Runtime v2.1
- Multi-tenant runtime control plane
- Scoped API keys and production authentication
- Signed webhooks with retries
- PostgreSQL/Supabase adapters
- Runtime event bus and real-time event subscriptions
- Atomic policy bundles with test-before-activate
- OIDC claim mapping and tenant-bound identity
- Administrative RBAC for owner/admin/operator/viewer roles
- Deterministic authorization remains the security authority


### Oversized request bodies no longer stall the next request (2.13.15+)

A stress test found that a request body larger than `maxBodySize` correctly returned `413`, but the server stopped reading the body as soon as the limit was crossed without draining the rest of what the client was sending. On a keep-alive connection, those unread bytes were still arriving and got misread as the start of the *next* request, so a completely unrelated follow-up request (even an auth check with a fake key) could hang for the full request timeout instead of returning `401` quickly — a cheap way to tie up connections.

2.13.15 fixes this by always fully draining the request body (even once it's known to be oversized — the rest is discarded, not buffered) before responding, and by sending `Connection: close` on `413`/`400` body-parsing errors so the client doesn't attempt to reuse a connection that was cut short either way. Regression tests in `test/oversized-body-recovery.test.js` repeat the exact sequence from the report (oversized request, then a fake-key request) and assert the follow-up never exceeds ~2s.

### Production Operations v2.1
- `/api/health` and `/api/ready` health/readiness probes (`/api/ready` reports `503` and `persistence.degraded: true` if persistence was recovered from corruption — see Persistence above)
- `/api/metrics` deterministic runtime counters and latency telemetry
- `/api/events` Server-Sent Events stream for runtime events
- Sliding-window HTTP rate limiting with 429 responses
- OIDC JWT signature, issuer, audience, expiry, and not-before validation for HS256/RS256/ES256
- Telemetry and event bus are exposed through the SDK

## Security hardening in v2.4

For authenticated multi-tenant deployments, MAGON treats the authenticated tenant identity as authoritative. Runtime runs and approvals carry `tenantId` and Control Plane reads, replay, approvals, behavior analysis, blast-radius analysis, webhooks and SSE are tenant-scoped. Request-body or query-string tenant overrides are rejected.

The MCP HTTP server is local-only by default. Non-local deployment requires an authentication hook. HTTP request bodies are size-limited. Webhook delivery blocks loopback, private, link-local and metadata targets, resolves DNS before delivery, and rejects redirects.

## Response / Data Egress Guard (2.8)

Protects the boundary between tools and agents. Enable it on the MCP gateway:

```js
const gateway = createMCPGateway({
  egress: {
    // default: sensitive credentials BLOCK, PII REDACT
  },
  tools: [/* ... */]
});
```

The guard detects common API keys, private keys, bearer tokens, JWTs, emails, phone numbers, and card-like values. Findings are deterministic and produce `ALLOW`, `REDACT`, or `BLOCK` decisions. Custom rules can change the action for a finding type. Egress decisions are recorded on the run and emitted as `egress.blocked` / `egress.redacted` events.

For direct use:

```js
import { createEgressGuard } from 'agentgate-runtime-control';
const guard = createEgressGuard();
const result = guard.guard(toolResult);
```

## Response / Data Egress Guard (2.8)

Protect the boundary between tools and agents. Enable it on the MCP gateway:

```js
const gateway = createMCPGateway({
  egress: {},
  tools: [/* ... */]
});
```

The deterministic guard detects common API keys, private keys, bearer tokens, JWTs, email addresses, phone numbers, and card-like values. Findings produce `ALLOW`, `REDACT`, or `BLOCK` decisions. Credentials default to `BLOCK`; common PII defaults to `REDACT`. Rules can be overridden per finding type.

```js
import { createEgressGuard } from 'agentgate-runtime-control';
const guard = createEgressGuard();
const result = guard.guard(toolResult);
```

MCP runs record egress decisions and emit `egress.blocked` / `egress.redacted` runtime events.


## Preflight and Security Validation

Before exposing an agent to real traffic, run:

```bash
agentgate doctor
agentgate simulate
agentgate validate-security
```

`doctor` validates configuration and fail-closed deployment assumptions. `simulate` shows the deterministic decision matrix before execution. `validate-security` runs the built-in runtime attack, pre-execution blocking, approval boundary, egress detection, malformed-input resilience and tenant-isolation checks.


## Security hardening

The default egress guard blocks and redacts generic sensitive fields such as `secret`, `password`, `private_key`, `access_token`, and `authorization`. See `docs/security-hardening-release-report.md` and the external/managed-PostgreSQL test packs.
