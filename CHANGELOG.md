# 2.14.13 — Package Metadata

- **Added `license`, `repository`, `homepage` and `bugs` to the package metadata**, so the npm page links to the source, the issue tracker and the MIT license. No runtime changes.

# 2.14.12 — Local Dev Session Hardening

- **`agentgate dev` now binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.** Previously it listened on all interfaces. Set `HOST=0.0.0.0` to expose it deliberately (for example in a container).
- **Local dev session no longer bypasses admin scopes when the server is not on loopback.** In that demo mode, routes requiring `admin:*` (keys, tenants, kill-switch, billing) answer `401` to a local-session cookie, while read and demo routes keep working.
- **Dockerfile sets `HOST=0.0.0.0`** so containerised demos stay reachable but run in demo mode without admin routes.
- Local development on loopback is unchanged. `.agentgate/` runtime state is no longer tracked in git.

# 2.14.8 — CLI Packaging & Release Hardening

- **Fixed CLI executable permissions.** `bin/agentgate.js` is now packaged with standard executable permissions so `npx agentgate-runtime-control@2.14.8 --help` runs correctly instead of failing with `Permission denied`.
- **Fixed npm CLI bin metadata.** The package `bin` path now uses the canonical `bin/agentgate.js` form.
- **Release check now verifies CLI executability.**
- **Release version bumped to 2.14.8.** Full regression suite: 205 tests, 205 passing.

# 2.14.7 — Security Defaults & Egress Hardening

- **Unknown actions now require approval by default.** `unknownActionPolicy` defaults to `ask`; strict production configurations can use `block`, while explicit `allow` is rejected by `agentgate doctor` in enforce mode.
- **Attack Lab defaults are fail-closed.** Built-in CI/strict attack runs use `unknownActionPolicy: 'block'`, so unrecognized dangerous action names cannot silently pass the security gate.
- **Egress Guard now treats API-key field names as secrets.** `api_key`, `apiKey`, `API_KEY`, `api-key`, and `apikey` are blocked and redacted even when their values do not match provider-specific key formats.
- **MCP egress regression coverage expanded.** Nested/array API-key fields and generic API-key outputs are verified not to leak their values.
- **Doctor/initialization guidance updated** to reflect the safer default posture. The `createAgentGate()` instance now exposes its effective policies so `agentgate doctor` validates the actual loaded project configuration instead of fallback defaults.
- **Release version bumped to 2.14.7.** Full regression suite: 205 tests, 205 passing.

# 2.14.6 — Independent Technical Review: 6 Fixes (Replay History, Payload Masking, Metric Labeling, Version Consistency, Guided Setup, Layout Overflow)

An independent technical review (install → test → dashboard → Attack Lab → approval flow → Replay → Observability) rated the project 8.5/10 for a limited trial and asked for 6 fixes before freezing further. All 6 are done:

1. **Replay now browses history, not just the latest run.** Added a searchable list (by run ID, tool, action, or decision) of recent runs, selectable in place, plus a per-run JSON export button — previously Replay only ever showed the single most recent run gateway-wide, with no way to find a specific past one.
2. **Monitor no longer shows raw approval payloads by default.** Pending-approval cards now show a short human-readable summary (action · tool · amount) first, with the full payload behind a "View details" disclosure — and sensitive-looking fields (customerId, email, token, card, etc.) are masked there too, while operationally necessary fields (action, amount) stay visible so an approver can still decide. Regression-tested in `test/dashboard-payload-masking.test.js`.
3. **Observability's "Success" metric relabeled.** It's now "Executed cleanly," with "Blocked" and "Approvals" labeled as protective outcomes, not failures, plus an explanatory line: "A BLOCK or an ASK is a policy outcome, not an execution failure."
4. **Version consistency is now enforced, not just fixed.** README.md updated to v2.14.6, and `release-check.mjs` gained a permanent check that the README's version string matches `package.json` — this is the third time a stale version string in prose confused a reviewer (2.14.2, 2.14.5, now this one), so going forward it's a release gate, not a one-off fix.
5. **Added a 3-button guided-setup block to Overview** ("Try the Demo," "Protect my first tool," "Set up PostgreSQL staging") with short, directly-verified-against-the-real-API code samples — not an earlier draft that invented two APIs that don't exist (`agentgate.registerTool()` on a `createAgentGate()` instance, and a non-existent `createPostgresAdapter()` subpath export). Both corrected samples are regression-tested against the real exports in `test/dashboard-guided-setup.test.js`.
6. **Fixed horizontal overflow** on some viewports (long unbroken strings — run IDs, hashes — pushing the layout wider than the screen). Added `overflow-wrap`/`min-width:0`/`max-width:100%` guards.

Plus three smaller items from the same review:
- Overview's demo stat tiles now say "Demo/sample metrics below — not your environment's real telemetry" instead of relying on a small badge alone.
- README documents the real subpath-export story (most things come from the package root; a few lower-level pieces like `createControlPlane`/`PolicyRegistry` are subpath exports) — this was previously undocumented and easy to guess wrong.
- The npm package no longer ships `docs/assurance/*` (the versioned historical evidence trail, 5 folders and counting) — it's meant to stay in git history, not bloat every consumer's install. `release-check.mjs` now guards this too.

No policy-evaluation/decision logic changed. Full regression suite: 200 tests, 198 passing (same 2 known Chromium-only browser-smoke failures, unrelated — 4 new regression tests added). `npm run release:check` passes all 14 checks (one new check added this release).

# 2.14.5 — Second Real Bug Fix: Dashboard's Example Policy Used a Shape the Engine Never Reads

- **Fixed a second real bug, found by the same colleague's third trial**: the dashboard's "New policy" modal pre-filled an example policy `{refund:{max:5000}}` — but the real policy engine (`src/policy-engine.js`) never reads a nested `refund.max` field; it only reads flat fields like `approvalAmount`, `autoApproveAmount`, and `requireApprovalForDestructive` (the same shape used everywhere else in this project: `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, `examples/basic.mjs`, etc). So the example policy silently did nothing, and the pre-filled test case in the "Test policy" modal (amount 100 → expected `ALLOW`) always failed, because any `refund` action falls back to "destructive action requires approval" (`ASK`) by default. Fixed the example policy to the real, documented shape (`{autoApproveAmount:500, approvalAmount:5000, requireApprovalForDestructive:false}`), verified against the live engine: amount 100 → `ALLOW`, amount 1000 → `ASK`, amount 6000 → `BLOCK` — exactly what the pre-filled test cases already expected.
- Added a regression test (`test/dashboard-policy-example.test.js`) that extracts both examples straight from `standalone.html` and checks them against the real engine, so the two can never silently drift apart again.
- The dashboard sidebar's version tag was hardcoded as static text (`AgentGate v2.14.1`) and had already drifted twice. It now fetches the real version from the already-public `/api/health` endpoint at load time, so it can't go stale again.
- Full regression suite: 196 tests, 194 passing (same 2 known Chromium-only browser-smoke failures, unrelated — 1 new regression test added). `npm run release:check` passes all 13 checks.

# 2.14.4 — Real Bug Fix: Dashboard "Create Policy" Always Showed an Empty List

- **Fixed a real bug, found by a second colleague trial**: `GET /api/policies` (the call the dashboard's Policies page uses to list everything) always returned `{"policies": []}`, even immediately after successfully creating a policy draft — the dashboard would show a "Draft ... created" success toast, then the list below would still say "No policies yet." The draft WAS being saved correctly to disk; it just could never be read back by the "list all" call. Root cause: `PolicyRegistry#versions()`/`list()` in `src/policy-registry.js` required an exact policy `name` to match anything, but the dashboard's "list all policies" call never sends a name (it wants everything). Fixed by treating a missing name as "match all," matching how the sibling `PolicyBundleRegistry.list()` already worked. This was a real data-visibility bug, not a UI/labeling issue — anyone using the Policies page to create more than a quick one-off policy would have hit it every time.
- Added a regression test (`test/policy-registry.test.js`) asserting `list()` with no name returns every policy, so this can't silently regress.
- Clarified the policy-name input placeholder so it reads as an example, not a pre-filled value (`"e.g. refund-safety — type a name, this box is empty"`).
- Behavior section now notes inline that a finding's count comes from Attack Lab/demo activity, not a real incident (in addition to the explanatory line already in the section header from 2.14.3).
- Blast Radius header now explains what "scope" and "targets" mean in plain language, and that the 0–100 score is a risk estimate, not an executive decision by itself.
- Full regression suite: 195 tests, 193 passing (same 2 known Chromium-only browser-smoke failures, unrelated — one new test added for the policy-list fix). `npm run release:check` passes all 13 checks.

# 2.14.3 — Dashboard UX Fixes (from a real colleague trial)

- Replaced the raw browser `prompt()` dialogs for "Create Policy" and "Test Policy" with a proper on-page modal form (name field, pre-filled example policy `{refund:{max:5000}}`, pre-filled example test cases, inline error message, Cancel/Create or Cancel/Run buttons). The old `prompt()` flow could silently hang the page for a tester who didn't expect a native browser dialog — this was the one real blocker the trial found.
- Added a "● LIVE" badge and a short differentiation line to the Behavior, Blast Radius, and Replay section headers, explaining how each one differs from Attack Lab and from each other, and that Attack-Lab-generated findings in Behavior are simulated test results, not real incidents.
- Clarified in the Monitor section header, and in the toast shown after approving a request, that `agentgate dev`'s demo tool handlers are harmless no-ops — approving a refund/delete/export in the demo does not perform a real side effect.
- Cost Control now shows one clear explanatory message ("cost tracking is not active yet — add pricing to see real numbers") instead of a row of `$0` stat tiles when no model pricing is configured, so a `$0` reading can no longer be mistaken for "spend is actually zero."
- No runtime/security/policy behavior changed — this release only touches `standalone.html` (the dev dashboard's UI/labeling). Full regression suite: 194 tests, 192 passing (same 2 known Chromium-only browser-smoke failures, unrelated). `npm run release:check` passes all 13 checks.
- Fixes all 5 recommendations from a colleague's hands-on trial of the live dashboard.

# 2.14.2 — Release-Engineering Consistency Fix

- Fixed stale "v2.13.8" version text in `README.md` (title and Design Partner Edition intro) and the `standalone.html` dashboard sidebar — both now correctly read `2.14.1`-era content matching `package.json`. (`bin/agentgate.js --version` was never affected; it already reads the version from `package.json` dynamically.)
- Fixed `npm run release:check` hardcoding a `2.13.x`-only version regex, which made it fail on every release past 2.13 for a reason unrelated to release quality. It now accepts any valid semver.
- Fixed three test files (`test/v19.test.js`, `test/egress-guard.test.js`, `test/production-hardening.test.js`) that used hardcoded `/tmp/...` paths instead of `os.tmpdir()`/`fs.mkdtempSync` — these failed with `ENOENT`/`EACCES` on any system where a world-writable `/tmp` isn't already guaranteed to exist (seen on a plain Linux checkout during an independent trial review; the same class of issue affects Termux and Windows).
- No runtime/security behavior changed. Full regression suite: 194 tests, 192 passing (2 known Chromium-only browser-smoke failures, unrelated). `npm run release:check` now passes all checks.
- Added `docs/known-limitations.md` items 6–9 (Attack Lab is a verification tool not a guarantee, protection depends on correct tool registration, load numbers aren't a production SLA, backup/incident-response remain the operator's responsibility) making points an independent trial review raised explicit rather than implicit.

# 2.14.1 — Write-Failure Observability & Crash-Safety Hotfix

- `PersistentCollectionStore.save()` still throws on every write failure (disk full, permission denied, ...) exactly as before — never swallowed — but now also records it on `lastWriteError`, which clears itself automatically the instant a later write succeeds.
- `gateway.persistenceHealth()` gained `writeErrors` alongside the existing `corruptions`; `degraded` is now true if either is non-empty.
- `GET /api/ready` now reflects an active write failure as `503`/`degraded: true`, the same way it already did for a recovered corruption, and recovers to `200`/`degraded: false` automatically once writes succeed again — no restart required.
- Fixed a latent crash risk in the control plane: a write failure (or any other thrown error) inside an HTTP request handler was previously an unhandled promise rejection capable of taking down the entire process over a single failed write. It is now caught and answered as a clean `500` for that one request; every other in-flight and future request is unaffected.
- Added `test/persistence-write-failure.test.js` covering all of the above.
- Closes the two open questions and the latent risk flagged by the independent 2.14 verification report following up on the real disk-full test.

# 2.13.8 — Production Readiness Pack
# 2.13.8 — Security Hardening

- Added generic sensitive-field egress protection for `secret`, `password`, `passphrase`, `private_key`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `authorization`, `auth_token`, `client_secret`, and `api_secret`.
- Sensitive-field values are redacted as `[REDACTED:SECRET]` and the egress decision is `BLOCK` by default.
- Added regression coverage for nested objects, arrays, inspection, and MCP egress behavior.
- Shipped example configuration defaults to `enforce` for the packaged runtime configuration.
- Forced PostgreSQL Row Level Security in the reference schema.
- Added an independent External Security Review test pack and a Managed PostgreSQL Production Acceptance test pack.
- No external security audit is claimed; those tests require an independent reviewer/managed provider environment.

# 2.13.6 — Release Test Harness Fix
- Fixed the dev Attack Lab browser smoke assertion to avoid regex escaping inside an injected template literal.
- Release test now uses literal substring matching for `5/5 protected`.
- No runtime security behavior changed.

# 2.13.6 — Live Attack Lab Wiring Fix
- Registered all built-in Attack Lab demo tools in `agentgate dev`: `export_all`, `update_production`, `delete`, `refund`, and `publish`, with explicitly simulated handlers.
- Added registered-tool discovery to the gateway and made missing Attack Lab tools report as `SKIPPED` with `unregisteredTools` instead of false security failures.
- Added a real `agentgate dev` Attack Lab integration smoke and browser integration harness.
- Attack Lab status is `PROTECTED` only when all scenarios execute; partial tool coverage is reported as `PARTIAL`.

# 2.13.4 — Release Hardening
- Fixed standalone Control Plane JavaScript syntax error in Audit Export.
- Added release browser smoke coverage for the standalone Control Plane.
- Completed live policy lifecycle UI: Create → Test → Review → Activate.
